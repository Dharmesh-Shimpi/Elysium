# Project Assumptions

This document outlines the key assumptions made during the development of the Cryptocurrency Tracking App. Understanding these assumptions is crucial for future development, maintenance, and potential modifications.

## üåê API & Data Source Assumptions

### Primary API Choice
**Assumption**: CoinGecko API was chosen over CoinMarketCap API
